# Demo Server #

A demo server of an OpenAirport implementation is available by clicking this [link](http://demoserver.openairport.org/).  It is limited to a code base slightly older than 2.1.2 and only has parts of the 327 and 339 inspection actions. There is more in the code base not shown here, but provides a general outline of how to enter and view inspections.

The username and password are provided to you on the demo server webpage, reading the Operation Manual may help with data entry and gaining a better understanding of how the version 2.0 system operates.

The new version 3.0 system under development functions about the same but is vastly better in every possible way. This link is provided for educational and for a historical perspective on where we came from to what is being crafted today.
