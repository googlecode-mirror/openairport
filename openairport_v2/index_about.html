			<h1>OpenAirport.org - What it Does For You</h1>
			
			<p class="post-by">
				OpenAirport.orf is a revolutionary record keeping system that exceeds that requirements of Federal, State, and Local Governments pertaining to airport operations. The system is easy to use, quick to learn, 
				and an accurate solution for all aspects of an airports operation. The reasons why OpenAirport.org is the benchmark for all other airport record keeping systems is clear.
				</p>
				
			<p class="post-by">
				OpenAirport.org is designed from the ground up to be the leading product for airports that has the lowest total cost of ownership.  The total cost of the software is zero dollars, yes, nothing.  
				As an Open Source software solution the software is yours to use as you please as long as you credit OpenAirport.org for the basis of your system.  As the base of your system the code that drives 
				OpenAirport.org may be changed in whatever detail you like. 
				</p>			
			
			<p class="post-by">
				Programmed in Zend PHP, MySQL AB Community Edition, and using either Microsoft IIS or Apache Group Apache server you can maximize your record keeping system with almost to no initial charges. Depending on 
				the scope of your operation the system can work out on your Aircraft Operations Area using your WPA Local Area Network. The larger your operation the more benefit you may see from the OpenAirport.org system.
				</p>				

			<p class="post-by">
				Since the system is programmed with all operations in mind, you may find little need to change how the system works, but that does not mean you can not.  The airport has complete control over how data is 
				used, who can see what data, what forms look like, how they work, and most importantly, total control over everything.
				</p>	

			<p class="post-by">
				The OpenAirport.org system is always under development, expanding fast, adding new modules and abilities on a daily basis. Each of the listed modules below can be used independent of each other or used 
				together to create a document management system for airports.
				</p>				
			
			<h3>Current Modules</h3>

				Each of these main modules contains many different sub modules which can be used to track different reports or documents you now do on paper.&nbsp; There is no limit to the number of modules or sub 
				modules you may have as OpenAirport contains no limits to how you may have.
				</p>				
			
			<p class="post-by">
				An airport may wonder if OpenAirport.org would work for their operation, chances are very good that no matter the size of your airport OpenAirport.org is perfect for you.&nbsp; Even if your airport has no 
				Human Resources with computer knowledge, database management, or computer programming; OpenAirport.org can be used in its default factory programmed settings with very few changes in the System Administration 
				module.&nbsp; If you would like part of your OpenAirport.org System customized by OpenAirport.org that is also possible usually at no cost.&nbsp; If your airport does have Human Resources with computer knowledge, 
				database management, or computer programming you can take full advantage of the Open Source nature of OpenAirport and customize the code.
