# Introduction #

To facilitate and encourage communication OpenAirport allows users to customize specific alerts or messages they receive from the system.

# Details #

Each user can have up to five different alerts setup that together create the nearly unlimited ability to establish what alerts they want to receive. And in case of a situation where the system wants to broadcast a message OpenAirport will send an alert even if a user hasn't asked for one.

Alerts can be sent via email or text and will be sent immediately once the conditions of the alert is met. Where the alert is sent is configured by the user in their control panel.
