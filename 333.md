# Introduction #

14 CFR Part 139.333 Protection of NavAids is a module designed around keeping track of PAPI/MALSR/REIL inspections and calibrations.

## Details ##

In order to ensure that your airports approach is safe, quarterly inspections of the PAPI/REIL are important as well as daily checks of the approach lighting system.  The Part 333 module allows an airport to keep track of their 333 inspections as well as issue discrepancies through the 327 system when problems are found.

## Videos ##

I am currently working on videos that will demonstrate how Part 139.333 works and will upload them to the official OpenAirport youtube channel. Please stay tuned.
