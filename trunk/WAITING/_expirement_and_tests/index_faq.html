			<h1>OpenAirport.org - F.A.Q.</h1>
			<br>
			<p class="post-by">
				OpenAirport.org often receives calls from other airports for advice, suggestions, and comments on how they can implement a system similar to 
				OpenAirport.org to meet the ever increasing demands of the Federal Aviation Administration. The easiest answer is to just use the OpenAirport.org 
				system; however, sometimes there are extenuating circumstances why the OpenAirport.org system will not run in their airport environment. For those 
				airports and for your airport you may find the following information useful.
				</p>
				
			<a name="#authority">Why are you qualified ?</a>
			
			<p class="post-by">
				Although not the most often question asked, it is perhaps the most important.  As an airport manager I often find my self in situations where there 
				is probably a more cost effective method to make the airport operate, and no doubt every other airport manager finds themselves in this very same 
				situation. When trying to solve these types of problems the true geek in me turns to the computer and creates easy to use, simple but accurate software 
				solutions. Over the years other airport operators have taken notice and seek my advise on how computers can make the airport meet their Part 139 
				requirements in the most accurate, efficient, and safe way possible. 
				</p>
			<p class="post-by">
				The end result is advice you can trust without the costly price. Stay tuned for the comprehensive research paper in your AAAE docket soon.
				</p>				
			
			<a name="#cost">Free, are you serious ?</a>
			
			<p class="post-by">			
				Yes; the OpenAirport.org system is 100% free with no strings or fine print and I am very serious. There are many reasons why the system is free, 
				some are outlined below:
				</p>
				
			<ul>
				<li> 
					There are two main products on the market which airports can use to fit the gap that OpenAirport.org fills. Eagle Integrated Solutions, Inc. and 
					Landrum & Brown ELS Part 139. In either case the software is bulky, expensive, and proprietary.
					</li>
				<li>
					Airports like any other organization or company must find ways to increase their productivity while decreasing their expenses. It is difficult 
					in good consciousness to recommend an airport spend any serious amount of money on a computer system that replaces an already existing paper 
					system. There is a benefit of the computer system over paper; however, an airport must question if the benefit is worth the going rate of $30,000 
					to $50,000.
					</li>
				<li>
					Airports are a long-term investment in a community and should make every attempt to ensure they are as self-sufficient as possible. Increasing the 
					airport self-sufficiency means decreasing the software used in your airport that is proprietary to another company. When an airport allows an outside 
					company control over the most instrumental part of their operation (Part 139) they lose control of the data, software, and create diversity with data 
					which is also instrumental to the Federal Aviation Administration.	
					</li>
				<li>
					The OpenAirport.org system is a framework in which an airport can create their own record keeping system and on its own is of no value. The airport 
					takes this framework and structure, inputs their own airports data and it is the most valuable tool they will ever have. It does require upfront labor 
					on the part of the airport to get working beyond its core function.
					</li>	
				</ul>
				
			<a name="#help">Can you help us make a system ?</a>
			
			<p class="post-by">			
				I sure can. Even if you do not want to use the OpenAirport.org framework I can supply you my own personnel knowledge about computers, inspections, and 
				airport operations to asset your airport operator in making a first-class system with minimal cash spent. Should you require advanced assistance such 
				as programming code, making graphics, or take a considerable amount of hand-holding I may ask for some financial assistance.
				</p>
				
			<a name="#wireless">Does OpenAirport.org work over a WAN ?</a>
			
			<p class="post-by">			
				The OpenAirport.org system is hosted on your own computer system which is accessible over the internet and Local Area Network so that pilots, tenants, 
				and other airport users can view any reports they have access to. 
				</p>
			<p class="post-by">		
				Since the system is already internet based, a user can access it anyway they want. 
				It can be accessed over the internet, the local area network, over a VPN, you name it. Give the Demo link a try in the environment you would like to test. 
				Use a Sprint Laptop Broadband card out on the field and see if that works, try the demo over a bridged network connection from the Ops Office, you will be 
				surprised how many different ways there are to gain access to the reports.
				</p>
				
			<a name="#demo">Is there a Demo I can try ?</a>
			
			<p class="post-by">			
				You bet, and you do not need to set up any special equipment or meetings to give it a try. It is encouraged to try the Demo from lots of different places 
				and see if the Demo will function the way you want it to. The online Demo functions just like the real system, it is in fact just another copy of the 
				OpenAirport.org system running in parallel with the OpenAirport.org system. It takes about 5 minutes to convert the OpenAirport.org system to another airport, 
				not coutning the time spent on making the maps, etc.
				</p>
				
			<a name="#google">Google Earth ?</a>
			
			<p class="post-by">			
				Google Earth is an excellent application which every airport should use for any number of purposes.  Because Google Earth shows the world in true 3D the 
				user is able to determine if there may be height restriction problems, plan future developments, get inside of an approach and see what a pilot sees, etc. 
				There is really no limit to what you can achieve with Google Earth. Give it a try by downloading it at <a href="http://earth.google.com/" target="_new">Earth.Google.com</a>.
