Things to do:

- Add Alerts (SMS) to a table in the database for tracking.
	= Add a DashPanel report that lists all active alerts in the DB
		= Allow linking to the reported action (if possible) 
	= Add a pop-up window that lists alerts since your last visit


- Touchscreen Interface, iconize everything...

- 303.c

	= Finish, must complete a list of what is and what is not finished

- 327

	= Completed initial development. Everything should work
	[Monitor] - If a discrepancy is outstanding, the list should show it?
	= Need to adjust auto entry on all forms as stated above...
	?? Should there be an option to auto close a discrepancy upon repair?

	!!!! There is something wrong with the discrepancy Save code.  Some type 
		of ID is crossed between the discrepancy ID and the repaired ID.
		causing new discrepancies to be repaired and use information from the
		wrong discrepancy, ie fixing discrepancies that were never suppose
		to be fixed. 

	!!!! The discrepancy display box on the inspection form needs to be fixed.
		it is badly broken. I'm thinking I'll just redo it from scratch.
