There are a number of ways to go about making a shape file for your defined surfaces used by the FiCON system.  The way I have done it is outlined below:

In the [truck](http://code.google.com/p/openairport/source/browse/trunk/documents/sources/raw_gps_builder.ods) is the open document foundation spreadsheet that details the process. Click "View Raw File" to download the sheet.

It isn't complicated, but it can take some time to trace all of the airport surfaces, export them to KML, copy the long,lat from the KML file to the OpenAirport import tool and then copied into the proper field of the defined surface, but once it is completed you can view your field condition reports in 3D.  Once you have done it, you will never look at Mu Values the same.
