#summary What is a WAMP Server?

= W.A.M.P. =

A WAMP Server is a server that is running Microsoft Windows, uses Apache as the web service, MySQL as the database backend, and PHP as the scripting language. 

== Types of WAMPs ==

There are many different configurations you can use to run a WAMP server a comprehensive list of different system setups can be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_WAMPs here], two very good applications that run straight out of the download with minimum configuration are:

 * [http://www.wampserver.com/en/ WAMPServer]
 * [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html XAMPP]

Both are great packages, I like XAMPP; however, tastes vary and so do system configurations. 

== Installing OpenAirport into a WAMP ==

To install OpenAirport onto a WAMP server two things must be done:

  * Import the OpenAirport SQL Statement using either MySQL Administrative Tools or PHPMyadmin.  Either is good; however, importing with PHPMyadmin can break Index and InnoDB connections.

  * Copy the OpenAirport code to the wwwroot directory of the WAMP Server (htdocs: Xampp, www: WAMPServer).  This is best done in its own subdirectory like C:/Xampp/htdocs/yourairport/openairport.
