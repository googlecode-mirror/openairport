=== Introduction ===

14 CFR Part 139.327 Airport Safety Self-Inspection describes regulations pertaining to how an airport ensures that all airport surfaces meet FAA requirements. There are extensive regulations and advisory circulars that an airport can use to ensure their self-inspection system is complete, accurate, and safe. 

The OpenAirport system utilizes the best business practices of the FAA and industry leading publications to create a Part 327 system that will support your airport for years to come. 

=== Background ====

At the core of a 327 program is the airports ability to not only detect problems on the airport, but to relay those problems to the proper authorities. Regardless of who the authorities are sending accurate and timely reports is important to ensuring any problems are fixed as soon as possible. Problems on an airport come in all shapes and sizes, some more serious than others, and some can bring an entire airport to a stop. Not only affecting the income from an airline, the tenants, but can expose the airport to increased litigation. As an airport you should not follow Part 327 just to meet the regulation, you should strive to make the regulation mean something because the information you can learn about your airport from frequent inspections can tell you more about your airport than you ever thought possible.

The OpenAirport system uses a closed-loop system to track airport problems, discrepancies. Think of a discrepancy as a living thing, it is born, it dies, and in between many things happen. Learn more about the Discrepancy Life Cycle by visiting the [http://code.google.com/p/openairport/wiki/DiscrepancyLifeCycle Life Cycle] page.

=== Details ====

Entering an Airport Safety Self-Inspection into the OpenAirport system is easy and follows the same logic as described in [http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/advisory_circular/150-5200-18C/150_5200_18C.pdf FAA AC 150 5200 18C] with some tweaks to ensure your inspectors have all the information available to them and be as automated as possible.

Entering a 327 inspection starts at the OpenAirport Dash Panel where any active discrepancies are shown and all recent inspections are displayed. In this case, there are no active discrepancies and no inspections for the day.  Any discrepancies would be listed under the 327 Discrepancies header and any inspections would be listed under the 327 Inspections Today. 

Navigate to the 327 menu item and select 'New'.
