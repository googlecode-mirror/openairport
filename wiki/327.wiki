=== Introduction ===

14 CFR Part 139.327 Airport Safety Self-Inspection describes regulations pertaining to how an airport ensures that all airport surfaces meet FAA requirements. There are extensive regulations and advisory circulars that an airport can use to ensure their self-inspection system is complete, accurate, and safe. 

The OpenAirport system utilizes the best business practices of the FAA and industry leading publications to create a Part 327 system that will support your airport for years to come. 

=== Background ====

At the core of a 327 program is the airports ability to not only detect problems on the airport, but to relay those problems to the proper authorities. Regardless of who the authorities are sending accurate and timely reports is important to ensuring any problems are fixed as soon as possible. Problems on an airport come in all shapes and sizes, some more serious than others, and some can bring an entire airport to a stop. Not only affecting the income from an airline, the tenants, but can expose the airport to increased litigation. As an airport you should not follow Part 327 just to meet the regulation, you should strive to make the regulation mean something because the information you can learn about your airport from frequent inspections can tell you more about your airport than you ever thought possible.

The OpenAirport system uses a closed-loop system to track airport problems, discrepancies. Think of a discrepancy as a living thing, it is born, it dies, and in between many things happen. Learn more about the Discrepancy Life Cycle by visiting the [http://code.google.com/p/openairport/wiki/DiscrepancyLifeCycle Life Cycle] page.

=== Details ====

Entering an Airport Safety Self-Inspection into the OpenAirport system is easy and follows the same logic as described in [http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/advisory_circular/150-5200-18C/150_5200_18C.pdf FAA AC 150 5200 18C] with some tweaks to ensure your inspectors have all the information available to them and be as automated as possible.

Entering a 327 inspection starts at the OpenAirport Dash Panel where any active discrepancies are shown and all recent inspections are displayed. In this case, there are no active discrepancies and no inspections for the day.  Any discrepancies would be listed under the 327 Discrepancies header and any inspections would be listed under the 327 Inspections Today. 

Navigate to the 327 menu item and select 'New'.

In AC 150 5200 18C and in 14 CFR Part 139.327 the FAA recommends than an airport conduct an inspection under four different scenarios. 1. A Regularly Scheduled Inspection, 2). Continuous Surveillance of Airport Activities, 3). Periodic Condition Evaluation, 4). Special Inspection.  As part of best business practices you should be in the habit of also conducting 5). Pavement Condition Evaluation Inspections. 

Each inspection type can have any number of inspection items or categories to sort by. click 'Get Checklist' once you have selected the checklist you want to use.

A checklist will display listing each of the items the inspector should be checking. Moving your mouse over each category can display an overlay that explains to the inspector what they should be looking for and what the regulation is.

It is not necessary to click any checklist item that is acceptable. An inspector only needs to click the check box for a checklist item that they discovered a problem in.

An Inspector has three choices on how they want enter a discrepancy for their inspection. 1). They can click the check box for a discrepancy in that checklist item and enter a discrepancy latter, 2). Click the 'ADD' button which will open a new window asking for information about the discrepancy, and 3). which we will cover latter.

In either of the two cases a screen like the one shows will be displayed. Provide a name of the discrepancy, some more information about the discrepancy, a priority level, and a location.

Clicking the 'Map It' button opens a high precision map of the airport that the inspector can click on to map the discrepancy.  If you click in the wrong spot you can re-click in the correct spot without reopening the map. The coordinates of the location clicked will be entered in the discrepancy form. 

The 'Kill Order' field is for situations where an inspector corrected the discrepancy while conducting the inspection but still wants to report the discrepancy. This practice is highly encouraged because the more information you collect the more useful some of the tools we will talk about latter become. If the discrepancy was not corrected out on the inspection do not enter any information in this field. 

Once the Inspector has entered all the information on the discrepancy form click the 'submit' button.  A summary of the information will be displayed (not shown) and you can close the window.

When all discrepancies for the inspection have been entered or all checkboxs entered that there was a discrepancy in, click the 'submit' button.

After the 'submit' button is clicked the form will display a list of all areas where a discrepancy had been noted along with any discrepancies that were added using the 'ADD' button. 

In the first section is the list of all checklist areas that a discrepancy was noted in.  This may include areas where you only clicked the discrepancy check box but never added a discrepancy. Click the 'Yes (manage)' button to add a new discrepancy.  There is no limit to the number of discrepancies that can be on an inspection. In the second area is a list of the discrepancies the Inspector added using the ADD button.  Discrepancies listed here may actually not be "your" discrepancies, they could be anyone's.  They can even be abandoned discrepancies that we will talk about latter. 

Once you have either added added more discrepancies and reviewed your link unassociated discrepancies you can click the 'submit' button to finalize the inspection.
