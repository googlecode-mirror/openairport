#summary 14 CFR Part 139.327 Airfield Safety Self Inspections

= Introduction =

14 CFR Part 139.327 Airfield Safety Self Inspections are the bases of all actions taken in Part 139.  A proper Self Inspection program will allow your airport to gain an insight into its operation that you never knew you were missing.

== Details ==

The Part 327 Module serves as the backbone of the OpenAirport system. OpenAirport uses a concept known as the [DiscrepancyLifeCycle] to manage work orders, track discrepancies, discover areas of trouble, and provide as much detail as an airport desires on areas around the airport.  


== Customize ==

More details on how to customize this module for your airport will be added in the future. For now possible considerations are included on the [custom327 customize module 327] page.
