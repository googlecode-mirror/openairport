= Introduction =

The Discrepancy Life Cycle is a concept that is a closed loop that ensures that all work orders are properly tracked, data integrity is enforced, and provides the tools necessary for multiple airport departments to communicate with each other about any discrepancies. 

== Stages of Life ==

  * All discrepancies start life in the [Discovery] Stage, here a discrepancy is located, information about it is reported, and information is checked to ensure accuracy. 

  * There are times when during an inspection the inspector will be able to fix the issue without a need to notify the maintenance department. In this situations the discrepancy should still be reported and a [KillOrder] can be issued that Closes the discrepancy on issue. 

  * When a discrepancy can not be fixed by the inspector, the discrepancy needs to be reported so that the corrective agency can repair the issue.  In the [Maintenance] Stage a discrepancy is under the control of the maintenance department.  

  * When the maintenance department has repaired the discrepancy, the discrepancy ages to the [Operations] Stage. Here the operations department has the opportunity to review the discrepancy, make comments and bounce the discrepancy back to maintenance to be reviewed and fixed again.  If the discrepancy is fixed, the discrepancy can be considered closed by the operations department.

  * [Closed] is the ultimate fate of all discrepancies. In this Stage a discrepancy comes to the end of its life, it has been fixed and is no longer an issue that needs to be fixed. 

== Ghosts Talk too ==

Just because a discrepancy is closed and no longer an issue for an airport to consider it is never forgotten by the system.  The discrepancy is used to track potential issues, show troubling hot spots around the airport and map out problems around the airport.
