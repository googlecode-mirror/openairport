= Introduction =

OpenAirport is an open source airport computer maintenance and management system.

==[Development]==

This is the home of the OpenAirport_v3t code depository. It is not completed nor ready for airport use. Development is underway and new code is added all the time. 

==Purpose==

The purpose of OpenAirport is to provide an open source Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) that has been designed from the ground up for airports. As an open source application; OpenAirport has the ability to be customized by an airport to meet their specific need, contribute code changes back to the source and make the application better.

==Goals==

The goal of OpenAirport is to allow interested parties (airports, consultants, interested aviation users) to help other airports by contributing code, making refinements, and suggesting features that will make OpenAirport more useful for airports in managing their Part 139 requirements. Help does not stop at Part 139 however, an airport is exposed to many regulations that no doubt could be assisted by modules in OpenAirport. 

==[Modules]==

The structural idea of OpenAirport is to keep the system as module as possible so an airport does not need to use all of the part and can mix and match different modules to meet their operational needs. There will be the core modules focused around Part 139.327, 333, 337, and 339; however, additional modules dealing with other aspects of Part 139 will be available. 

Each module can come in different flavors of depth.  From tracking global discrepancies to narrowing discrepancies down to the nuts and bolts of lights is important.  This ability to dynamically meet an a
