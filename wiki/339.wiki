=== Introduction ===

14 CFR Part 139.339 Field Condition Reporting describes regulations pertaining to how an airport shares information about what the airfield looks like going beyond what discrepancies there are on the field like in Part 139.327. 

This is done in two ways a), Through the NOTAM system, and b). Through internal communication that provides specific information about the airport to all tenants and users. Part 139.339 (b) describes NOTAM procedures and Part 139.339 (c) describes the specific information for tenants an airport will share. 

=== Background ====

Accidents happen and it is our job as Airport Management and Operations Personnel to keep our airports safe, efficient, and economical. Even though we do our best accidents can still happen and that is why the prompt and proper reporting of what the airfield looks like is so important.  So important in fact that a Google search will yield more information about FiCON reporting than you may imagine. 

There are a few important things to be aware of. The FAA is currently in the process of determining what information a pilot really needs to make informed decisions on landing and take off performance and the current direction is to diminish the Mu value and be based more on a systematic overview of the surface and boil that down to a single number a pilot can use to do their calculations. 

From a world where field conditions were recorded in Good, Fair, Poor, Nil, to one where only 'quantifiable' Mu values were provided, to a more holistic approach isn't a bad thing and OpenAirport works to ensure your airport has the ability to provide information to the pilot in a format you can use and they will want.
