=== Introduction ===

14 CFR Part 139.339 Field Condition Reporting describes regulations pertaining to how an airport shares information about what the airfield looks like going beyond what discrepancies there are on the field like in Part 139.327. 

This is done in two ways a), Through the NOTAM system, and b). Through internal communication that provides specific information about the airport to all tenants and users. Part 139.339 (b) describes NOTAM procedures and Part 139.339 (c) describes the specific information for tenants an airport will share. 

=== Details ===

The most common use for 14 CFR Part 139.339 is in Winter or Special Operations that require additional detail about the airfield that a 14 CFR Part 139.327 inspection wouldn't necessarily (and probably shouldn't) include. 

in OpenAirport a Field Condition Report (FiCON) is tied to the surfaces at your airport. By default there is only one type of FiCON as opposed to the basic four type of 327 inspections; however, there is no limit to how you design and build your own FiCONs. There is no preferred order in which to file your 327 or your 339 FiCON.  The FiCON will pull information from known NOTAMs closing surfaces as needed or opening them as you make changes during the snow removal process.
