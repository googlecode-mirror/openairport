#summary Regulatory Training Matrix

= Introduction =

14 CFR Part 139 outlines some of the basic training required to meet the requirements of the part.  These requirements are shown in the training matrix.  It is important to note that 14 CFR Part 139.321 and 337 have special restrictions and will most likely require an airport to invest in a special training class or education materials. If an onsite certified wildlife biologist is on staff an airport will be able to do training in 337 in house, where as only special classes are available for 321. 

Contact your Certification Inspector about the requirements of 337 and 321.  The other areas are typically easier for an airport to train in-house decreasing costs and allowing training to be completed as needed throughout the year rather than once every year.

14 CFR Part 139 provides only the basic requirements an airport should focus on for training and in some areas misses some very obvious connections between the parts. As shown in the Training Tower, the first five requirements in 303 form the base of the Core Group (color: green) of training requirements that are needed to conduct any duties on an airport. 329 builds upon this with actual policies that should also be trained within the core group. 

Cells colored Orange are not required by regulation but would otherwise be impossible to conduct the duty correctly without being trained in that task. 

It is also important to note that the matrix isn't a syllabus it is what the training should be about.  Your airports syllabus should reference these regulatory requirements as well as any applicable advisory circulars. In OpenAirport you can create your [Syllabus] in anyway you wish.  More about the [Syllabus] can be found on the [Syllabus] page.
