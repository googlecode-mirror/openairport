=== Introduction ===

14 CFR Part 139.303 Personnel is a comprehensive part that ties many of the modules together in the way of educating your staff to be able to carry out the tasks they are assigned. The foundation of the Training Tower comes from the [RegulatoryTrainingMaxtrix Training Matrix]

=== Details ===

There are two components to a successful Part 303 implementation. The first component is the knowledge of who your staff is, what their duties are, and what you expect of them.  The other component is the training they receive in order to conduct those tasks.  The primary focus on Part 303 is in the training they receive in their assigned duties.

Although secondary to the regulation the management of staff is important to get an overall image of what is going on at the airport. OpenAirport allows you to view each staff member, their access levels, how many of each type of record they have created, when their most recent entry was completed, and make changes to their biographical information as needed.  This is an invaluable tool in determining if someone may be missing paper-work or on the opposite side of the spectrum is responsible for a majority of the discrepancies or other paper-work reported.

In many airports the staff responsible for carrying out the duties of the Airport Certification Manual will have significant overlap; however, there are few specific regulations as well that do not carry over into the other regulations well or at all. Part 139.319 and 321 have special requirements that typically require specific education and training. Where as although Part 139.337 specifics specific training requirements it has significant overlap with Part 139.327 and 339. 

This overlap of function and duty builds on the basic training found in Part 139.303 and 329. Think of Part 139.303 and 329 as the foundation of a tower with witch all of the other aspects build upon. Five towers rise from the base while three have significant feedback between themselves. 

==== The Operations Tower ====

Part 139.327, 337, and 339 form the Operations Tower. Because these regulations have significant feedback between themselves their training  can usually be combined throughout the year to meet the requirements of Part 139.337 for a total of eight hours of training. If an airport uses a special class for the purposes of training wildlife or has specialized wildlife biologists is may be best to consider 337 as its own training tower similar to 321 and 319. The goal of OpenAirport is to allow the airport to break down this training to manageable sessions throughout the year meeting the core group requirements plus all the components of the Operations Tower.

==== ARFF Tower (319) ====

It can be said that ARFF has little overlap with the training requirements of those duties in the Operations Tower.  Depending on your airports operations; ARFF training maybe done by the city, county, airport, or some other 3rd party group. The goal of OpenAirport is to allow an airport to track that ARFF training has been completed but not break down the training into syllabus format. 

==== Fuel Training (321) ====

There are few airports where the airport will train the FBO on fuel operations unless the airport is the FBO. There is little to no overlap of 321 to any other part of the regulation other than the core group and as such the goal of OpenAirport is allow an airport to track that training was completed but not breakdown the training into Syllabus format. 

==== The Syllabus ====

The [Syllabus] works and functions just like many of the other forms in OpenAirport. Allowing you to customize a training plan, track training completed and prepare reports that document when and what was trained. 

==== Supporting Documents =====

You may upload a class sign-in sheet and class outline to a training record.  This allows you to minimize the [syllabus], and focus on the main topics of the class.  In addition to the supporting documents you can also add students to each class.

==== Student Attendance ====

In order to keep track of which classes a student is in and to track their total training time it is necessary to add each student in a class to that training record.  This is done through the manage student attendance form within the training record report. You can learn more about student attendance [managestudents here]

==== Walk-through ====

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_1.png]

Like all other module walk-through we will start at the dash panel. There are a number of discrepancies from 327 inspections displayed and many other panels that do not have much else to say to use at the moment.

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_2.png]

In the spirit of sharing I included a new menu system build in this walk-through. The idea is that it is touch friendly (which a goal for everything eventually), and it works rather well. Listed here are all the regulations of 14 CFR Part 139. 

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_3.png]

Once I clicked on the 303 button, the menu changes to show you the sub groups in 303, mainly 303 (a) and (c). Also listed are a back button, a back to the beginning button, and a back to dash panel button. At any time you can close the menu and it remembers where you last were. Clicking on the 303 (c) to continue.

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_4.png]

Like the menu before this screen lists the available options for this menu level. We can Browse records or add a new record.  Click New to continue.


[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_5.png]

This selection of the training checklist is like all of the other checklist selection screens. Select Operations Training and click the 'Get Checklist' button. 


[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_6.png]

Once the button is clicked the checklist will be displayed along with some information about the checklist, if you actually taught that topic, how long was spent on each topic, and if you want to add any notes about that topic.   Clicking 'ADD' opens a new window.


[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_7.png]

it is a simple form, enter a note name, and some remarks about your note. You can use this for anything.  I attempted to be funny with what I typed in, see if you can find it latter.

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_8.png]

Once you have entered the information you want in the detail level you like. Click the submit button. The screen above will be displayed. In this screen you can review your topics, upload documents, manage student lists, and add additional notes if you like.

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_9.png]

The upload document screen is as easy to use as you can expect from OpenAirport. Select the files from your computer and click 'Save Documents'.  

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_10.png]

The Manage Student list is straight forward. Select a student from the list and click the 'ADD" button. the student will than show up on the bottom part of the form. The form wont let you add the same student twice and will warn you if you try. You can also remove a student from the list if you selected the wrong student.  

I encourage you to select your students at least for your regular students because of what we can do with that data latter.

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_11.png]

The classic form save screen, click "Display Report" to see it.

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_12.png]

The summary report shows the information you would expect. Who taught the class, who the students were, the topics covered, any notes provided, and a link to uploaded documents ( I didn't upload any for this example). The total time taught is shown in minutes and hours.

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_13.png]

if you go back to the 303 (c) browse screen, and move your mouse over "Form Utilities" there are a couple of options available. Let's look at the 'Year End Report' and 'Distribution Chart'. 

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_14.png]

The Year End Report lists all the students who have taken a class for the given period (not necessarily a year) and the topics covered.  the students are listed across the top in pseudo vertical format, the total amount of time is also provided for each topic across all students. 

At the bottom of the page is the total amount of time each student has and the total amount of time across all training across all students.

[http://openairport.googlecode.com/files/303_c_step_15.png]

Similar to the Year End Report is the Distribution chart. Each topic has the number of minutes trained in that category and at the bottom of the page is a bar chart that compares the amount of time spent in each topic.
