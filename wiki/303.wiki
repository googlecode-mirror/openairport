=== Introduction ===

14 CFR Part 139.303 Personnel is a comprehensive part that ties many of the modules together in the way of educating your staff to be able to carry out the tasks they are assigned. 

=== Details ===

There are two components to a successful Part 303 implementation. The first component is the knowledge of who your staff is, what their duties are, and what you expect of them.  The other component is the training they receive in order to conduct those tasks.  The primary focus on Part 303 is in the training they receive in their assigned duties.

Although secondary to the regulation the management of staff is important to get an overall image of what is going on at the airport. OpenAirport allows you to view each staff member, their access levels, how many of each type of record they have created, when their most recent entry was completed, and make changes to their biographical information as needed.  This is an invaluable tool in determining if someone may be missing paper-work or on the opposite side of the spectrum is responsible for a majority of the discrepancies or other paper-work reported.

In many airports the staff responsible for carrying out the duties of the Airport Certification Manual will have significant overlap; however, there are few specific regulations as well that do not carry over into the other regulations well or at all. Part 139.319 and 321 have special requirements that typically require specific education and training. Where as although Part 139.337 specifics specific training requirements it has significant overlap with Part 139.327 and 339. 

This overlap of function and duty builds on the basic training found in Part 139.303 and 329. Think of Part 139.303 and 329 as the foundation of a tower with witch all of the other aspects build upon. Five towers rise from the base while three have significant feedback between themselves. 

==== The Operations Tower ====

Part 139.327, 337, and 339 form the Operations Tower. Because these regulations have significant feedback between themselves their training  can usually be combined throughout the year to meet the requirements of Part 139.337 for a total of eight hours of training. If an airport uses a special class for the purposes of training wildlife or has specialized wildlife biologists is may be best to consider 337 as its own training tower similar to 321 and 319.

==== ARFF Tower (319) ====

It can be said that ARFF has little overlap with the training requirements of those duties in the Operations Tower.  Depending on your airports operations; ARFF training maybe done by the city, county, airport, or some other 3rd party group. The goal of OpenAirport is to allow an airport to track that ARFF training has been completed but not break down the training into syllabus format. 

==== Fuel Training (321) ====

There are few airports where the airport will train the FBO on fuel operations unless the airport is the FBO. There is little to no overlap of 321 to any other part of the regulation other than the core group and as such the goal of OpenAirport is allow an airport to track that training was completed but not breakdown the training into Syllabus format. 

==== The Syllabus ====

The Syllabus works and functions just like many of the other forms in OpenAirport. Allowing you to customize a training plan, track training completed and prepare reports that document when and what was trained.
