14 CFR Part 139.337 Wildlife Hazard Reports is how an airport would record wildlife actions taken against animals on airport property.  

== Details ==

Keeping accurate records of wildlife activity on your airport is important so that methods can be taken to understand your specific airport issues, what the trends are in wildlife in your area, and to better control habit modification.   

== Videos ==

I am currently working on some videos that will showcase how the Part 337 system works that will be uploaded to the official OpenAirport youtube channel. Please stay tuned.
