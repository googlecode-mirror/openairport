At the heart of OpenAirport is the Part 139.327 Airport Safety Self-Inspection Module from which all other modules contribute information, assist in the management of discrepancies, and ensure proper work flow for the maintenance of your airport. 

== The Focal Point ==

14 CFR Part 139.[327] serves as the focal point of an airports operation. It ensures that an airport is always operating in the most safe and efficient way possible by managing discrepancies, tracking work-orders, and providing detail to airport staff on areas around the airport that may be either currently a concern or potential areas of concern.

== The Core Four ==

In addition to the focal point of 14 CFR Part 139.327, three other regulations form the Part 139 Core:  

  * Part 303: Personnel 
  * Part 333: Protection of NavAids
  * Part 337: Wildlife Hazard Management
  * Part 339: Airport Condition Reporting

== The Outer Four ==

Within the core are the main functions that an airport would use on a daily bases to ensure continued safe and efficient operation; however, without the Outer Four an airport is missing out valuable tools for long-term planning and protection. The Outer Four are:

  * Part 305: Paved Areas
  * Part 309: Safety Areas
  * Part 311: Marking Signs and Lighting
  * Part 335: Public Protection

== Lines of Communication ==

Even the most robust of computer systems are worthless if their not used and no one communicates with one another about what is going on at the airport. The Core Four and The Outer Four serve as functional modules that drive data collection but to facilitate and encourage communication OpenAirport takes a step forward and allows the user to be [alerted] when new records are created, edited, displayed, etc.
