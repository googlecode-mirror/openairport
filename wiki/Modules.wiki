At the heart of OpenAirport is the Part 139.327 Airport Safety Self-Inspection Module from which all other modules contribute information, assist in the management of discrepancies, and ensure proper work flow for the maintenance of your airport. 

== The Focal Point ==

14 CFR Part 139.[327] serves as the focal point of an airports operation. It ensures that an airport is always operating in the most safe and efficient way possible by managing discrepancies, tracking work-orders, and providing detail to airport staff on areas around the airport that may be either currently a concern or potential areas of concern.

== The Core Four ==

In addition to the focal point of 14 CFR Part 139.327, three other regulations form the Part 139 Core:  

  * Part 303: Personnel 
  * Part 333: Protection of NavAids
  * Part 337: Wildlife Hazard Management
  * Part 339: Airport Condition Reporting

== The Outer Four ==

Within the core are the main functions that an airport would use on a daily bases to ensure continued safe and efficient operation; however, without the Outer Four an airport is missing out valuable tools for long-term planning and protection. The Outer Four are:

  * Part 305: Paved Areas
  * Part 309: Safety Areas
  * Part 311: Marking Signs and Lighting
  * Part 335: Public Protection
