#summary development of OpenAirport

= Introduction =

OpenAirport is programmed in PHP with a MySQL database backend. Scripting is completed using top down methods with extensive moduler includes. The main reason why Object Orientated Programming is not used is two fold: 1). I don't know it well, and 2). Top down is much easier for someone not used to programming to understand and modify.  

The modular nature of the system and the ability to add includes provide an object functionality to the system without the need for objects.  

== Source Code ==

The source code for the current development version 3 is here at the Google Code depository. It may be downloaded by anyone interested in OpenAirport and modification can be completed by any registered user of Google Accounts. 

== You Can Help ==

If you are an interested party in airport operations and source code, you too can help develop OpenAirport into a better system for all airports to use.  Please review the code, and suggest features you would like, options to add or subtract and consider the depth of an airport operation in your code.  Don't presume modulate.
